#Angular Recipes

This is a collection of notes which will influent the contents of a book I want to write
about AngularJS. The book will be available for free (forever!) as an online book as well 
as in different kind of book formats like epub, pdf, mobi etc..

Please fork these notes and add *your* ideas or problems which should be covered in the
book as recipe.

**This is a WIP, feel free to provide any useful structure or categorizing for the recipes.
I want to make this book community-driven!**
